Following President Trump's third appointment in just under four years, there has been widespread talk of a potential "[conservative revolution][1]" on the Supreme Court. The idea, as it goes, is that the GOP could use their commanding 6-3 majority on the court to shape the legal landscape of the nation for decades to come.

However, before we can fully understand the potential implications of this "[unusually big jump to the right][2]," we must first come to know the individual justices themselves&mdash;which is exactly what this post will focus on.

We'll take an in-depth look at each of the 9 active justices, their histories, beliefs, and unique tendencies.

The Supreme Court [consists of 9 justices][3] appointed *for life* by the sitting President with consent of the U.S. Senate.
